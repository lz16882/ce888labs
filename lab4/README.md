- [ ] In this lab, only research the e-decreasing, UCB and bootstrap from the examples
- [ ] Change the reward of each function from 1,0 to 1,-1 and do the plots, the results are followed.
It is found when the value of trails increases, it is long for the loop to run, and the results will be more clear and accurate.

- [ ] Change the rewards of each function to 10,-10 and redo the plots
